## 🏗️ Building Executable (Windows App)

To convert this Python application into a standalone Windows `.exe` application, you can use **PyInstaller**. We have provided a pre-configured `AashuJewellers.spec` file that includes all assets, database folders, and the application icon.

### 1. Install PyInstaller
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Build the Application
Run the following command from the project root. This command uses the spec file to package the app.

```bash
py -m PyInstaller AashuJewellers.spec
```

### 3. Distribute
Once the build is complete:
- A `dist` folder will be created in your project directory.
- Inside `dist\AashuJewellers`, you will find `AashuJewellers.exe`.
- You can copy this entire `AashuJewellers` folder to any Windows machine.
- *Note: The target machine must still have the Microsoft Access Database Engine installed to connect to the `.accdb` file.*

## 🔗 Creating a Desktop Shortcut

**If running from the built Executable (`.exe`):**
1. Navigate to the `dist\AashuJewellers` folder.
2. Right-click on `AashuJewellers.exe`.
3. Select **Send to** > **Desktop (create shortcut)**.
4. The shortcut will appear on your desktop with the app's beautiful icon.

**If running directly from Python (`main.py`):**
1. Right-click on your Desktop and select **New** > **Shortcut**.
2. Enter `python "C:\path\to\your\project\main.py"` (Update the path to wherever the app is located, e.g., `python "e:\dukan app\main.py"`).
3. Name it "Aashu Jewellers".
4. To set the icon: Right-click the shortcut > **Properties** > **Change Icon...** > **Browse** to `assets\icons\app_icon.ico` and apply.
